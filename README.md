## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code][1] is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

## What is this repository?
This repository contains my Matlab solutions for each year's Advent of Code event. In most cases the provided solutions represent a "first-thoughts" approach to the day's problem rather than the most efficient. I go for simple functions rather than efficiant and short as time is of the essense. 

## Why Matlab?
I have gotten this question a couple of times now. I believe Matlab is a really good tool when it comes to quickly testing thoughts and ideas. It has very powerful built-in functions and is easy to debug, and to see values of arrays.
Python, which would be my second language, is also a bit slower in most occations. I also don't think there are many Matlab-solvers out there, so thats a fun challange.
